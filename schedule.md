- This schedule might change slightly during the quarter. The dates of the final exam, however, will not change.

- Slides will be uploaded here, usually after each lecture. The lectures themselves might often deviate significantly from the textbooks in the order, presentation, and actual content. Thus, it is mandatory to attend a lecture live or view its video asynchronously.

- The industry guest lectures are not included in the syllabus for the exams. But they will be the focus of the extra credit Peer Evaluation activities.

- Some topics may take a few weeks to cover.
